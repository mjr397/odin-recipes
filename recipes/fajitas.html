    <h1>Pepper Fajitas with Refried Beans</h1>
    <h1>Description</h1>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>1 red pepper</li>
      <li>1 green pepper</li>
      <li>1 yellow peppers</li>
      <li>1 red onion</li>
      <li>3 tbsp fresh coriander</li>
      <li>1 tin mixed beans</li>
      <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
      <li>&frac14; tsp chilli flakes</li>
      <li>1 tbsp tomato pur&eacute;e</li>
      <li>1 lime</li>
      <li>150ml soured cream</li>
      <li>4 wholemeal tortillas</li>
      <li>40g rocket leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 190&deg;C/Gas Mark 5. Slice the peppers, dice the onion, chop the coriander, and drain and rinse the beans in a colander.</li>
      <li>Put the peppers on a baking tray, drizzle over 1 tbsp olive oil and season with a little salt and black pepper. Roast on the top shelf of the oven until soft and a little crispy, around 20-25 minutes.</li>
      <li>Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and fry for 5-7 mins until soft. Add the beans, cumin, chilli flakes, tomato pur&eacute;e and 100ml water. Season with &frac14; tsp salt and a little black pepper. Cover and cook over a medium-low heat for around 15 mins, until the beans start to break down.</li>
      <li>Zest the lime and stir half the zest into the soured cream. Season and add lime juice to taste.</li>
      <li>Remove half the beans to a bowl. Mash the beans in a pan with a potato masher or fork, then return the other beans to the pan along with half the coriander.</li>
      <li>Warm the tortilla in the oven for 2 mins (reheat the peppers if necessary). Toss the rocket leaves in lime juice, tsp olive oil, a little salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Serve the peppers, refried beans, citrus soured cream, rocket and remaining coriander in separate bowls.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <p>For a fully vegan dish, we can substitute e.g. Alpro yogurt for the soured cream.</p>
